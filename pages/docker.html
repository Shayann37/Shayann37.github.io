            This Docker training has significantly broadened my knowledge and understanding of containerization technology. Although I had some exposure to Docker previously, this dedicated training session provided me with a comprehensive understanding of its principles, functionalities, and real-world applications. Throughout the training, I gained hands-on experience with Docker, learning how to create, deploy, and manage containers effectively. This practical experience proved invaluable during my internship, where Docker was a key component of our development environment. It allowed me to better comprehend the intricacies of containerization and leverage Docker to streamline the development and deployment processes of our projects.
