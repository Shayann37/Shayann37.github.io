        <p class="text-content">In 2022 I took part at my first EPHEC's Hackaton</a></td>  <br><br>
            A hackathon is a weekend event where teams of 3 to 5 people have to develop a project during the weekend.  
            It was the first time I participated in a hackathon. It was a very enriching experience. I was able to learn how to work with a team and manage our time.  <br><br>
            The theme was about sustainable development.  <br><br>
            
We developed an application aimed at facilitating the buying and selling of products using geolocation services. With our platform, users can easily browse, buy, and sell a variety of items within their local area. I'm proud to share that our application garnered significant recognition, earning us the first place in the competition! <br>
