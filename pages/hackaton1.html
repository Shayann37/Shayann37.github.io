        <p class="text-content">In 2022 I took part at my first EPHEC's Hackaton</a></td>  <br>
            A hackathon is a weekend event where teams of 3 to 5 people have to develop a project during the weekend.  <br>
            It was the first time I participated in a hackathon. It was a very enriching experience. I was able to learn how to work with a team and manage our time.  <br>
            The theme was about sustainable development.  
            We developed a platform to exchange re-usable things such as hardware/books/etc between EPHEC students, and we won the third place! <br>
