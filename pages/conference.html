        <p class="text-content">Earlier this year, I took part in a conference on cyber security given by Forum financier Brabant wallon

            The conference had two main speakers. <br>
            The first was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vincent Ceriani</span>, Head of CyberRisk Services at NRB, and the second was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Beno√Æt Debande</span>, CEO of CHIREC, a group of 3 hospital sites.
            
            As I'm already interested in cyber security, I wanted to attend this conference. <br>
             By the end of it, my desire to enter the cybersecurity sector to really understand what is going on behind it had only increased.
